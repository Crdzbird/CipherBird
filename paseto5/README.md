# paseto5

A header-only C++20 token library: v5.local (XChaCha20 with a keyed
BLAKE3 key split and a key-committing tag) and v5.public (Ed25519 plus
ML-DSA-65, both required), a typed claims layer that validates before it
trusts, key types that cannot be confused, PASERK-shaped key strings and
ids, and local key wrapping. It is CipherBird's proposal for a successor
to PASETO version 4; it is not a paseto-standard version (docs/SPEC.md,
section 1).

Status: 0.1.0, built and verified on this branch as described at the end
of this file. Not yet reviewed by anyone but its author.

## Install

Dependencies: libsodium 1.0.18 or later, BLAKE3 (libblake3), and, for
v5.public, liboqs with libcrypto. On this Mac they come from Homebrew
and are found through pkg-config.

```
cmake -S paseto5 -B paseto5/build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build paseto5/build
./paseto5/build/paseto5_tests
```

Options: `PASETO5_PQ` (default ON; OFF builds without liboqs and without
v5.public), `PASETO5_BUILD_TESTS`, `PASETO5_BUILD_BENCH` (needs the
cryptolib headers at `../include`), `PASETO5_FUZZ` (LLVM clang),
`PASETO5_SANITIZE` (ASan + UBSan, the same flags as the root project).

To use the library, add the `include` directory, define `PASETO5_HAS_PQ`
when liboqs is linked, and link libsodium, libblake3 and (for PQ) liboqs
and libcrypto; or `add_subdirectory(paseto5)` and link `paseto5::paseto5`.

## Thirty seconds

```cpp
#include <paseto5/paseto5.hpp>

auto key = paseto5::LocalKey::generate().value();

paseto5::Claims claims;
claims.iss = "https://issuer.example";
claims.aud = "api";
claims.sub = "user-1";
claims.exp = now + 3600;
claims.iat = now;
(void)claims.set("role", "admin");

auto token = paseto5::Token::seal(key, claims, "request-context");

auto rules = paseto5::ValidationRules()
    .expect_issuer("https://issuer.example")
    .expect_audience("api")
    .with_replay_check([&](std::string_view jti) { return seen.insert(jti); });
auto opened = paseto5::Token::open(token.value(), key, rules, "request-context");
if (opened.is_ok()) use(opened.value().sub);
else log(paseto5::error_name(opened.error()));
```

The token carries the key's id in its footer; `Token::open` rebuilds that
footer from the key and refuses any other. `exp` is required unless the
rules say `allow_missing_exp()`; an expected audience and issuer are
required unless the rules say `allow_any_audience()` and
`allow_any_issuer()`, and rules that say neither are `rules_incomplete`
before the token is read. The replay check is optional; installed, it
receives the `jti` of every token that passed every other rule and may
refuse it. A token longer than 16 KiB is refused before it is read.

For v5.public, `SecretKey::generate()`, `Token::sign(sk, claims)` and
`Token::verify(token, sk.public_key(), rules)`.

## Examples

`examples/international_text.cpp` builds as `paseto5_example_text` and
answers one question: does the text policy make a token safer than the
same token through a library without one? It seals eight tokens and
looks at each twice, once with a legacy check (authenticate, parse the
JSON, take every string as it comes) and once with `Token::open`. Same
key, same cipher, same tag; only the text handling differs. The
scenarios are a subject that renders as `admin` but carries a zero-width
space, a bidi override that makes a log line read `useradmin`, a
`\u200b` escape that a scan of the raw payload does not see, a key id
that displays as `prod` and is not, overlong UTF-8 that a lenient
decoder reads as `../`, the same issuer written raw and escaped (one
identity) against its composed and decomposed forms (two), and a
tampered token, which gets `invalid` and nothing more. In every spoof
the legacy check accepts and paseto5 refuses on both the issuing side
(`argument`) and the verifying side (`claims_malformed`), and the
program asserts exactly that, exits non-zero otherwise, and runs in CI
as a test. Run it and look at how the spoofed strings render:

```
./paseto5/build/paseto5_example_text
```

`PASETO5_BUILD_EXAMPLES` (default ON) controls the target.

## API

Everything is in namespace `paseto5` and reached through
`<paseto5/paseto5.hpp>`. Every function returns `Result<T>` (value or
`Error`) or, at the buffer level, `Status`.

Keys (`keys.hpp`)

- `LocalKey`: 32 uniformly random bytes. `generate()`, `from_bytes(span)`,
  `from_paserk("k5.local...")`, `to_paserk()` (wiped string),
  `paserk_id()` (`k5.lid...`), `key_id()` / `set_key_id()` /
  `clear_key_id()`, `clone()`. Move-only; no implicit copies. The
  importers refuse a key whose bytes are all equal.
- `PublicKey` (1984 bytes) and `SecretKey` (6048 bytes), with liboqs:
  `SecretKey::generate()`, `public_key()`, `consistent()`, the same
  PASERK functions with `k5.public`, `k5.secret` and `k5.pid`. Importing
  a secret key checks that its public halves belong to its secret
  halves.
- `KeyWrap::wrap(wrapping, key)` / `unwrap(text, wrapping)`:
  `k5.local-wrap`.

Tokens

- `Local::seal(key, msg, footer, implicit)` returns the token text in one
  allocation; `Local::open(token, key, expected_footer, implicit,
  max_token_bytes)` returns the message in wiped memory in one
  allocation and refuses a token longer than `max_token_bytes` (default
  1 MiB) before reading it. `seal_into` and `open_into` write into caller
  buffers sized by `token_len` and `open_capacity` and allocate nothing.
- `Public::sign` / `verify` and `sign_into` / `verify_into` likewise,
  with the same default limit on `verify`; `verify_into` takes a buffer
  sized by `verify_capacity`, which includes the scratch for the
  pre-authentication encoding, so it allocates nothing either. The
  ML-DSA half signs under the FIPS 204 context string `v5.public.`.

Claims (`claims.hpp`)

- `Claims`: `iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, `jti` as optionals
  (times as Unix seconds, written as RFC 3339), `set(name, string)`,
  `set_json(name, json)`, `get(name)`, `get_json(name)`, `to_json()`,
  `from_json()`, `text_ok()`.
- `ValidationRules`: `expect_issuer`, `expect_audience`,
  `expect_subject`, `allow_any_issuer`, `allow_any_audience`,
  `with_replay_check(fn)`, `with_clock_skew`, `with_max_token_bytes`,
  `allow_missing_exp`, `at(now)`; `complete()`, `check(claims)`.
- `Token::seal` / `open` / `sign` / `verify` / `peek_key_id` /
  `footer_for`.
- `Rfc3339::parse` / `format`; `json::Reader` / `json::Writer`.
- `text::valid_utf8`, `text::identifier_ok`: strings are UTF-8 in any
  script and compared byte for byte; identifiers (iss, sub, aud, jti,
  custom claim names, key ids) may not carry controls, invisible or bidi
  characters, noncharacters or private use (docs/SPEC.md 8.4).

Errors: `invalid` (anything token-dependent before authentication, one
verdict), `too_large`, `argument`, `rules_incomplete`, `internal`,
`unavailable`, and after authentication `claims_malformed`,
`missing_exp`, `expired`, `not_yet_valid`, `issued_in_future`,
`issuer_mismatch`, `audience_mismatch`, `subject_mismatch`,
`missing_jti`, `replayed`.

## Benchmark

`paseto5_bench`, Release build, Apple clang 21, this Mac (Apple silicon),
idle machine, 2026-11-03. Each cell is the median of seven repeats of at
least 200 ms of back-to-back calls, in time per operation; a 44-byte
footer, an empty implicit assertion, the same libsodium 1.0.22 and
libblake3 1.8.7 under every implementation. Two runs agreed within a few
percent; this is the first.

| implementation | seal 64 B | seal 1 KiB | seal 64 KiB | open 64 B | open 1 KiB | open 64 KiB |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| paseto5 v5.local (caller buffers) | 2631 ns | 6567 ns | 204.2 us | 1225 ns | 5168 ns | 209.0 us |
| paseto5 v5.local (allocating) | 2699 ns | 6638 ns | 209.8 us | 1303 ns | 5381 ns | 226.6 us |
| cryptolib v4.local | 1938 ns | 5641 ns | 250.1 us | 1921 ns | 5739 ns | 257.5 us |
| cryptolib cb1.local | 1271 ns | 5096 ns | 211.9 us | 1206 ns | 5176 ns | 217.4 us |

64 KiB throughput (seal / open): paseto5 306 / 299 MB/s, v4.local
250 / 243 MB/s, cb1.local 295 / 287 MB/s.

Reading: open is at parity with cb1 at every size and 36 percent faster
than v4.local at 64 B; at 64 KiB paseto5 is the fastest of the three on
both sides (one keyed XOF call for the key split, the PAE streamed
through a buffered sink). Seal is 1.4 us slower than cb1 at every size,
and that 1.4 us is exactly the per-token `randombytes_buf` call that the
design requires in place of cb1's per-thread nonce batch (docs/SPEC.md,
section 12, question 5). The allocating convenience functions cost a few
percent over the caller-buffer functions for one allocation. The absolute
numbers depend on how the Homebrew libblake3 was built; the comparison
does not, since all three share it.

## What is covered and what is not

Covered on this branch: v5.local, v5.public, the claims layer, key types
and ids, k5.local-wrap, international text in claims, footers and key ids
(with the self-checking example above), the hardening from the
adversarial review (rules that must declare their audience and issuer,
the raw-layer size limit, the replay check, the weak-key and secret-key
import checks, the ML-DSA context string), the vector files, the official-v4 cross-check of
PAE and base64url, tests under ASan and UBSan, the three fuzz targets, a
build without liboqs, and the benchmark above. The repository's CI runs
the same matrix on every push and pull request: the `paseto5` job
(macOS: release with v5.public, ASan and UBSan, a build without liboqs,
one minute of each fuzz target) and the `paseto5_linux` job (Ubuntu,
v5.local only against the pinned static dependency set).

Not covered: a C ABI and language bindings (the repository's bridge is
not touched), interoperability with any other implementation (there is
none), a constant-time probe run under Valgrind (the root project has a
ct probe; paseto5 does not yet), review by a second person, and the
open questions in docs/SPEC.md section 12.

## Verification performed

All on this Mac on 2026-11-03, from the branch as committed.

- Release build (`cmake -S paseto5 -B paseto5/build -G Ninja`, Apple
  clang 21, `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wconversion -Wsign-conversion
  -Wshadow`): zero warnings. `paseto5_tests`: 59 cases, 59 passed,
  about 24,600 checks (the exact count varies with the random lengths in
  the codec agreement test).
- The same with `-DPASETO5_SANITIZE=ON` (AddressSanitizer + UBSan, no
  recovery): 59 of 59, no reports. The sanitizer build caught one bug
  during development, an iterator pair taken from two temporaries in
  the vector generator, which is fixed; the library itself produced no
  report at any point.
- `-DPASETO5_PQ=OFF` (no liboqs): builds, 47 of 47 cases, v5.public
  absent as specified.
- `paseto5_example_text`: zero warnings, all eight scenarios hold their
  expectations in the release, the sanitizer and the no-liboqs builds.
- Known-answer vectors under `tests/vectors`: 11 v5.local success
  vectors reproduced byte for byte and 15 failure vectors rejected, 99
  single-character tamper cases of a 99-character token all rejected;
  6 v5.public success vectors verified and 14 failure vectors rejected,
  38 sampled tamper cases rejected and every byte of a 4512-character
  token swept live; 40 claims-layer vectors with the recorded verdicts
  (among them incomplete rules, replayed and missing token ids); 3 weak
  local keys and 5 corrupted secret keys refused on import;
  the PASERK vectors reproduced.
- Official PASETO v4 vectors (`tests/vectors/paseto/v4.json` in the
  repository): all 9 v4.local tokens reproduced byte for byte and all
  3 v4.public tokens reproduced and verified through paseto5's own PAE,
  base64url, token splitting and footer comparison, and the 5 failure
  vectors rejected. This validates the two building blocks paseto5
  shares with v4.
- libFuzzer (`/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang++`, `-fsanitize=fuzzer,
  address,undefined`): `fuzz_local` 146,067 runs in 131 s, `fuzz_public`
  143,169 runs in 131 s, `fuzz_claims` 10,489,676 runs in 121 s; no
  crash, leak or timeout. A one-minute confirmation campaign per target
  was run again from the saved corpora after the last header edit.
- Benchmark: the table above, two runs.

Not verified here: behaviour on Linux or Windows, the constant-time
property under a dynamic probe (Valgrind is not available on this Mac),
and any review by a second person.
